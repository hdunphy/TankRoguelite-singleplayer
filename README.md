 A work in progress rogueLite with tanks.

**Game Title:** Tank Tactics

**Overview:**
Tank Tactics is a roguelike game that combines tactical precision shooting with strategic decision-making. Players control a tank in a 2D environment and must navigate through procedurally generated levels, engaging in challenging encounters with enemy tanks. The goal is to strategize and defeat each enemy tank using unique movement abilities, special ammo types, and acquired upgrades.

**Core Gameplay:**
1. Tank Controls: The player controls their tank using intuitive and responsive controls, allowing for free movement in the 2D environment.
2. Encounters: Each level is composed of various encounters with enemy tanks. Encounters can range from one-on-one battles to multiple enemy tanks simultaneously.
3. Precision Shooting: Players must aim carefully and strategically to hit enemy tanks while avoiding their attacks. The emphasis is on precise shots rather than overwhelming bullet hell mechanics.
4. Tactical Strategy: Each enemy tank possesses distinct movement abilities and special ammo types. Players must observe enemy behavior, plan their approach, and adapt their strategies accordingly.
5. Upgrades and Loot: Throughout the game, players can acquire different ammo types, movement upgrades, increased ammo capacity, faster projectile speed, and extra health. However, players can only carry a maximum of two types of ammo at any given time, promoting strategic decision-making.
6. Procedural Generation: Levels and encounters are procedurally generated, ensuring a unique experience in each playthrough. Randomly placed environmental obstacles can provide cover or strategic advantages.

**Progression:**
1. Permadeath: When the player's tank is destroyed, the game ends, and the player must start a new run.
2. Unlockable Tanks: As players progress, they can unlock and choose from a variety of tanks, each with unique attributes, movement capabilities, and starting equipment.

**Visuals and Audio:**
1. Visual Style: Tank Tactics features colorful and visually appealing 2D graphics with detailed tank sprites and destructible environmental elements.
2. Sound Effects: Each tank movement, shot fired, and collision will be accompanied by satisfying sound effects that enhance the tactile feel of the gameplay.
3. Music: The game will have a dynamic soundtrack that adapts to the intensity of the gameplay, with catchy tunes that create an engaging atmosphere.

**Platforms:**
Tank Tactics will initially be developed for PC but will have the potential for expansion to other platforms such as consoles and mobile devices.
